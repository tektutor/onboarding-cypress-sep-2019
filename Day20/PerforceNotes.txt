Depot
	- Version controlled folder ( equivalent to git repository )

Stream
	- Branch with restricts in change propagation

Legacy Branch
	- Regular branch with no restriction in change propagation

Workspace
	- Local Folder where all code changes are performed

Checkout
	- The user must checkout a file before modifying the same so that Perforce
	  will track the changes.

Submit
	- a.k.a Checkin. This is equivalent git commit.  You are basically
	submitting your changes to version control ( Perforce ).

Perforce Stream
	- are nothing but branches with some rules for change propagation
	- Perforce supports 5 types of streams
			1. mainline
			2. development
			3. release
			4. virtual 
			5. task ( Private branch typically used for bug fixes or new features )
	- mainline stream rules for change propagation
		- Merge down and Copy up
		- Changes can be taken from mainline to  development, however merge is required. In certain cases, manual conflict resolutions is required.
		- Once the merge conflicts are resolved in development stream, changes
		  can be moved to mainline without any need for merging

	- development stream rules for change propagation
		- Changes are allowed to come from mainline to development stream but
		  merge is required
		- Changes can be pushed to mainline without any need for Merge

	- release stream rules for change propagtion
		- Changes are not allowed from mainline to release stream
		- However changes can be merged from release  to mainline(parent)
